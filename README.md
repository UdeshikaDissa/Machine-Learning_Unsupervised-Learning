The objective of this assignment is to analyze and model a customer data set that contains annual expenditure data on various product categories from a wholesale distributor. The dataset has been obtained from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository and it contains annual spending data for various product types recorded in monetary units (m.u.) of 440 customers. In detail, it contains the expenditure data on six different product categories: Fresh, Milk, Grocery, Frozen, Detergents Paper, and Delicatessen. Also, it has two auxiliary labels (i.e Channel and Region) that can be used to validate the model by treating them as true observations. A better insight of data through this analysis would enable the wholesale distributor to best custom their services in order to optimally cater the needs and requirements of different customers. In this exercise, two different clustering methods (K-Means and DBSCAN) have been used to model the data and selected the better model by comparing the model results against the true observations. Confusing Matrices have been constructed for each clustering method and for different parameters to select the best clustering method and itâ€™s optimal parameters.
